  <h2>Professional Self-Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Computer Science student with experience in software development,
    data analysis, and system design. This ePortfolio highlights selected
    artifacts and enhancements that demonstrate my ability to design,
    implement, and improve software solutions using industry-standard
    practices. These projects reflect my growth throughout the Computer
    Science program at SNHU and support my preparation for professional
    software development roles.

  <h2>Code Review <span class="tag">CS 499</span></h2>
  <p class="muted">
    This comprehensive code review covers all selected artifacts for my CS 499 Capstone ePortfolio.
    It reviews existing functionality, identifies areas for improvement, and outlines planned enhancements
    across software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Instructor
    feedback from Milestone One was incorporated to improve clarity, organization, and technical explanations.

  <h2>Enhancement One: Software Design &amp; Engineering <span class="tag">CS 499</span></h2>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Artifact:</strong> CS 340 Enhanced Dashboard (Python + Dash)</p>

  <p>
    This enhancement refactors my original CS 340 dashboard application into a modular, layered architecture.
    Data access logic was isolated into a dedicated module, configuration and environment-specific settings were
    centralized, and user interface layout and callback logic were separated into clearly defined components.
    These changes improved readability, reduced coupling, and made the application easier to maintain and extend.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> separated UI, configuration, and data-access layers</li>
    <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> improved organization for easier updates and testing</li>
    <li><strong>Security mindset:</strong> removed hardcoded values and improved configuration handling</li>
  </ul>
